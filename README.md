# Teacher's Pet

*Teacher's Pet* is a classic pinball table that was reproduced (simulated? emulated?) for Visual Pinball version 10 (VPX) by the later user, Loserman76 (his real name was Jeff Whitehead).

I chose his pinball table as an excellent test-case for learning a little about scripting in VPX — specifically for a series of blog posts where I would walk through how to update the sound code and sound resources to use an improved library of sounds and code that are more dynamic.

Beginning with the orginal script from Loserman76's table, I walk through exploring the script, linting, copying in new sound code, replacing the sound resources, cleaning up the DOF support, adding a few new sound features and debugging. For these posts, the file changes are kept here in this repository for reference. The posts are:
